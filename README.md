# Armored-Antivirus

Antivirus or anti-virus software is used to prevent ,detect and
remove malware including but not limited to computer viruses,
computer worm, trojan horses, spyware and adware. The software
used for the prevention and removal of such threats.
Our software is coded in Python capable of scanning selected files
and deleting files that it detects as infected.

 In Quick Scan we check the common area for computer viruses.
scanned areas can include computer memory in short here we scan
the whole C drive.

The “Armored Antivirus” is a generic antivirus approach that will
detect the suspicious behaviors of the files that are scanned and it
avoids the pitfalls of the signature scanning method and provides full
security to the user.

This project has dropped a small stone in water, by designing an
application that provides a generic antivirus approach that is used to
scan the files efficiently. “Armored Antivirus” being developed by
restricting the present technology available in our college meets the
desired needs of the requirements completely
